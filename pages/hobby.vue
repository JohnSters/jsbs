    There are 5 area shows presented across South Africa in Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Free State, Kwa-Zulu Natal, and Gauteng. Additional to this a South African National Championship Show is presented in one of the areas each year.
    <br><br>
    <b>Various clubs also host Additional Championships shows.</b>
    <br>
    Regular Mini Shows are held so members can see how there birds compare to other members in the club.
    <br>
    There is a great social side to the hobby in that members get together for meetings as well as discussions and aviary visits. Regular Braai's are planned were the family can get together with others in the hobby. See our year program for more details.
    <br>
    If you are interested please feel free to contact any JSBS member and plan a visit to discuss the hobby.
